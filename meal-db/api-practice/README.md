## The Meal App
### https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/~nj16/api-practice
##
#### The Meal app was created using Angular and the Ionic Framework and
#### was meant to be a way for me to practice making API calls and displaying
#### the returned information to a web app.
##
## Basic functionality:
#### The Meal app has 3 main functions.
#### 1.) Generate a random meal
#### 2.) Search a meal by name
#### 3.) Search meals by first letter of the name
##
## TBD:
#### -- Improved Search Functionality to include portions of names and lower case spelling

## The Movie Forum
### https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/~nj16/themovieforum/
##
#### The movie forum is an application built using Angular 11 and the 
#### Ionic Framework and is optimized for mobile devices. All movie information is pulled
#### from the omdb API.
##
## Basic functionality:
#### The movie forum is an application that allows users to search endless
#### movies and tv shows alike. The users can then add their favorite shows
#### to the "my favorites" page to keep track of all their favorite cinema.
##
## TBD:
#### -- User authentication to login for a more personalized experience
#### -- further implementation of the API to allow for more film data to be passed
#### -- More user interaction such as comments and ratings

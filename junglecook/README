### https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/~nj16/junglecook/

#### DESCRIPTION:
##### Jungle cook is a CRUD application fitted to work on both personal computers
##### and mobile devices. Jungle Cook allows users to search other users' recipes,
##### create their own, delete them, and update them to form the perfect recipe!
##
#### USABILITY DETAILS:
##### -- Sign up does not currently work, to sign in, simply use admin as the username and password
##### -- edit recipe works, but is bugged. Exercise caution when editing recipes
##### -- The site is currently only a template and has NO storage implementation
##### -- RECIPES WILL RESET ON PAGE RELOAD
##
#### UNDER THE HOOD
##### -- JavaScript
##### -- JSON
##### -- JQuery
##### -- HTML, CSS/SCSS
##### -- Sweet Alerts 2
##
#### TBD:
##### -- Storage implementation to keep users and recipes on reload
##### -- Signup implementation
##### -- Bug fixes
##### -- Correct Edit page functionalities
##### -- Fix file attachment
##
#### HOW IT WORKS:
##### On load, you will be brought to the home page. Use the navigation bar at the top of the
##### screen to find your way throughout the website. The browse page allows you to view recipes
##### pulled from the database. None of the information on this website is hard-coded, so what you
##### see is directly manipulated by the model which pulls information directly from the database.
##### You will notice that you are unable to access the create a recipe page until you have logged in
##### on the login page. In order to login, you can use 'admin' as both the username and password for now.
##### SIGN UP CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK. Once you are logged in, you may now access the create a recipe page
##### and the 'your recipes' page. Try creating a recipe! You should notice that the recipe automatically 
##### appears on the your recipes page after you create it... You should also notice that you can delete
##### your new recipe if you so choose. YOU CAN TRY TO EDIT THE RECIPE, BUT MAY NOTICE THAT SOME
##### INFORMATION MAY BE LOST. In order to logout once you are finished managing your recipes, click
##### the logout button on the navigation bar...
